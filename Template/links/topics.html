                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a language used to markup documents like web pages in the World Wide Web. Through this, browsing over the web becomes standardized via the markup language. The hypertexts are displayed in a way it is structured using the language. This allows the user to view the web page beautifully and understandably in accordance to standard.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In 1989, Tim Berners Lee invented the web.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tim Berners Lee is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C was founded in 1994, it is an organization specifically of the web which develops specification, guidelines, software and tools to fully use the functionality of the web. Sir Tim who is working in CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory developed the idea of collaboration among different scientist in the whole world. With his idea, documentation of scientific and mathematical nature would be done through the web. Of course Sir Tim’s idea could be done using some sort of hypertext. The birth of the web gives life to the language of creating web pages, the Hypertext Markup Language.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In <strong>1991</strong>, Sir Tim invented the <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. The <em>HTML</em> was based on <em>Standard Generalized Mark-up Language&#40;SGML&#41;</em> in which it markups the text. Most of the element tags that were developed are taken from the existing markup language like <i>p, h1 through h6(headings), ol(ordered lists), ul(unordered lists), li(list items)</i> and more which comes in pair. One example is, <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</code>.The idea of basing HTML to SGML was brilliant, it added to the reliability and acceptability into the internet community. Although a lot of the element tags are just inherited from SGML, Sir Tim invented his own tags such as the use of anchor element with the HREF attribute.</p>

                        <div class='timeline-cont'>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In <strong>1992</strong>, Sir Tim’s HTML seems to be viral when he shared his idea in the WWW-talk mailing, an electronic type of discussion in which people exchange their ideas. A lot of enthusiast got interested with Sir Tim’s idea and started to work in the development of the markup language. Still in the same year, NCSA invested an effort in Sir Tim’s idea. Also, NCSA developed their first web browser named, Mosaic. A sudden appearance of Marc Andreesen triggered the creation of IMG tag which is used in the insertion of photographs, diagrams, illustrations and others in the HTML files.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In May 1994, the first conference in Geneva was organized by CERN, the World Wide Web Conference. A lot got excited on what the HTML can contribute and do on the web so as for humans.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;During the year 1995, many of the new tags and attributes were developed. Some of which are BGCOLOR attribute for the BODY element and the FONT FACE for documents font styles. <em>HTML  2.0</em> lasted over six months to be the standard of markup languages.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Before version 3.2 of HTML is the <em>HTML 3.0</em>. The version was never included as a standard markup language for the web because of the changing browser features. That is why in 1997, World Wide Web Consortium endorsed <em>HTML 3.2</em> as a cross – industry specification. The version is thoroughly reviewed by all the members of the organization, including Netscape and Microsoft, a browser vendor. This version highlights the additional tags for tables, applets, text flow around images, subscripts and superscripts.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In <em>HTML 4.0</em> it offers three variations, strict, transitional and frameset. Elements and tags deprecated are forbidden, however it can also be transitional where deprecated elements are sometimes allowed. Also in HTML 4.0 Netscape’s visual markup features are deprecated in favor of the style sheets. During 1998, a minor revision is made with the HTML 4.0 but no increment of version number happened.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In 1999, a newer version of HTML 4.0 is issued. In <em>  HTML 4.01 </em> they introduced depreciation of presentational elements and attributes in favor of style sheets. Still the version retained the three variations present in the previous version.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;After the release of HTML 4.01 no HTML versions were developed during the early and mid-2000’s. Thus, the rise of XML – based language, <em>XHTML</em> occupied the W3C’s HTML Working Group. XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language is another markup language for reformulation of HTML 4.01. At least 3 versions of XHTML were published, mainly of XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1 and XHTML 2.0.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In 2008, W3C work back in the draft of new version of HTML 4.01, which is the <em>HTML5</em>. W3C works hard to remove the SGML resemblance to HTML5. The released of new element tags such as section and article under HTML5 allows it to deprecate some tags present in the previous version. By this, they defined the new serialization for HTML5 in addition to the XHTML5 serialization. From a Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation, HTML5 was then released as W3C Recommendation.</p>
